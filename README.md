# E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
## Project Background
The company is a UK-based e-commerce business that has been selling gifts and household items for adults and children through their website. The dataset used includes sales transactions over one year (December 2018 to December 2019). This company needs to identify potential customer segments to target their market more effectively and efficiently.
